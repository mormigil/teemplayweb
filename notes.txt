//notes
write ajax functions within each other to keep variables present because they only last during the function.
make sure that if there is a parser error only json is in the response with no other text.
:: calls must be to static functions

make sure to set background-attachment to fixed for full page backgrounds it is the key to not being weird with scrolling
